# rm-resource-groups
Prevent your Azure bill from running wild by using GitHub Actions to remove Resource Groups conditionally. In this lesson I show how you can automate the removal of Azure resources on demand or by schedule. With GitHub Actions and an Azure account you can prevent services from running wild and causing unnecessary billing overcharges!

With automation in place, there is no need to remember what VM you left running!

First, you'll start by creating a GitHub Action that authenticates to Azure, then you will query locally your resource groups to identify which ones you can delete. Next, you will port the query over to the Action workflow. Finally, you will delete resources that match, making sure those are fully removed, preventing a large bill.

## Check with consumption
Rough steps to double check with consumption over a certain dollar amount:

1. List all resource groups for the given subscription: `az group list`
2. Get consumption: with
```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $AZURE_TOKEN" -X GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID_DEMOS/providers/Microsoft.Consumption/usageDetails?api-version=2021-10-01
```
3. From the consumption output, look at *an existing group* and then check dollar amount:
```python
In [15]: for item in usage:
    ...:     print(f"Resource Group: {item['properties']['resourceGroup']}")
    ...:     print(f"    Cost in USD: {item['properties']['costInUSD']}")
```
4. Nuke it with `az group delete -n $GROUP_NAME`

## Nuke it based on name
Query the list that contains a name and produce matches:

```
az group list --query "[?name.contains(@, 'demo')]" | jq '.[] | .name'
```
